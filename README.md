# Simba.js

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Set up a modern backend app by running one command. This project has the goal to create a complete setup for a backend application using `TypeScript` and `Express`. It will create many files that are usually created manually. Currently the following files are being created:

- `.env`
- `.eslintignore`
- `.eslintrc`
- `.gitignore`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `Dockerfile`
- `heroku.yml` (optional)
- `LICENSE` (optional, `MIT` as example)
- `nodemon.json`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `tsconfig.base.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `webpack.config.js`
- `yarn.lock`  (or `package-lock.json`)

## Installation

This package is meant to be installed globally in your computer by using:

```bash
npm i -g @anthonylzq/simba.js
```

## Usage

<!-- Also, if you don't want to install it globally, you can use npx as follows:

```bash
npx simba.js
``` -->

As developer you have two main options to create your new project, one is by running:

```bash
simba -q
```

By doing this your prompt will ask you the following questions:

- `Yarn or npm?`, only one of them is valid.
- `Project name:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Project description:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Author:`, at least one character must be provided.
- `Email:`, a correct email address must be provided.
- `Project version (0.1.0):` the initial version of the project, `0.1.0` as default.
- `Select your license [1...7]:`, the license you have chosen for the project.
- `License year (current year):`, the year where your license starts, current year as default.
- `Will this project be deployed with Heroku? [y/n]:`, yes or no question, only **y** or **n** is accepted. This is not case sensitive.

The second option you have is by passing flags in one single command. If you need help, please run:

```bash
simba -h
```

This will generate the following output:

```bash
simba [options] (if you it installed globally) or only simba if you want to be
asked for the options one by one

Regardless of the option chosen, a new folder will be generated with the name of the project, it will contain the following structure:

### Examples

Let's suppose you want to build a project that will be deployed to Heroku, so should run:

```bash
simba -N myProject -D 'This is a test' -l mit -a myName -e myEmail@email.com -H
```

Here we are specifying that we want to create a new project called `myProject` using the `MIT` license, my name and my email are respectively: `myName` and `myEmail@email.com` and I want to use heroku to deploy this server.

As default, `yarn` is selected as package manager, but if you don't want to use it, you can pass the flag `-n` or `--npm` as follows:

```bash
simba -N myProject -D 'This is a test' -l mit -a myName -e myEmail@email.com -H -n
```

Finally, you may not want to use a license or one of the available licenses, don't worry, just don't pass the flag `-l` neither `--license` as follows:

```bash
simba -N myProject -D 'This is a test' -a myName -e myEmail@email.com -H
```

### Some considerations

- This project was based in other project from my own, [`typescript-project-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-project-generator), but only considering the `express-mongoose` part.
- You are able to run a server that has one main route, `home` (`/`), `user` (`api/user` or `api/user/:id`) and `docs` (`api/docs`).
- To connect your server with your `MongoDB` database, you need to provide your `uri` in the `.env`. By default, Simba will try to connect to a local database. The content of the `.env` file is:

  ```bash
  MONGO_URI = mongodb://mongo:mongo@mongo:27017/${projectName}
  ```

  Where `${projectName}` will be replaced by the name of the project you provided in lowercase.
- Once you have done that, now you can perform the following `HTTP REQUEST`: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.
- In order to use global variables, just add the one you need in the `src/@types/index.d.ts` file, and add a new `var` with its type to the `global` interface, as follows:
    ```ts
    // src/@types/index.d.ts

    // Some code...
    declare global {
      var globalStringVariable: string
      // Some more code...
    }
    // Some more code...

    // another file
    global.globalStringVariable = 'Hi mom, I am global'
    console.log({ globalStringVariable })
    ```

- The provided project structure is inspired in my personal experience as [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) developer and the [`Nest`](https://nestjs.com/) framework. It follows a layered architecture:

  1. Presentation layer (network layer): it is represented by the network folder, which contains the routes and the necessary schemas for each route.
  2. Business layer (services layer): it is represented by the services folder, which contains all the code related to the business logic of your application.
  3. Persistance layer (database layer): it is represented by the database folder, which contains the database connection, models and queries (that will be used by the services). Multiple database connection are possible and should be implemented here.

- The server is fully tested and has no errors (at least for now), feel free to report one [here](https://github.com/AnthonyLzq/simba.js/issues).
- Support for windows and linux platforms is available.
- To check the content of the files generated, please check the `example` folder.
- If you provide a project name that contains spaces, something like 'My awesome Project',  every space will be replaced with a hyphen. So at the end your project name will be 'My-awesome-project', but in its README.md file, the hyphens will be removed and the project name will be parsed to title case (My Awesome Project).
- Finally, `git` will be initialized and a list of libraries will be installed. Check the [**notes**](#notes).
- Relative imports is already configured, you do not need to import a file using `../../../some/very/nested/stuff/in/other/folder`, you can use `some/very/nested/stuff/in/other/folder` assuming that your folder is under the `src` folder.
